Welcome to url shortener!

On this website, you can:
  - create new shortened url for long urls that you don't want to use on the main page "/" or creating page "/urls/new".
  - edit all existing shortened urls on the editing page "/urls". Either change a long URL that corresponds to a certain shortened url, or delete the pair all together.
  - go to your destination page by typing "localhost:8080/u/your_shortURL" in the address bar. That easy!

Note:
  Before running the code, you should install all library in package.json

Thanks for viewing!
